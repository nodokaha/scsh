\chapter{Writing CGI Scripts in Scheme}\label{cha:cgi-scripts}
%
The \ex{cgi-scripts} structure provides functionality useful for
writing CGI scripts in Scheme.

\defun{cgi-form-query}{}{data-alist}
\begin{desc}
 CGI scripts receive their parameters in various ways, depending on
 how they were called (e.g.\ by \ex{GET} method).
 
 This procedure translates the delivered form data into an alist of
 decoded strings, using the environment variables set by the server
 (\ex{REQUEST\_METHOD}, \ex{QUERY\_STRING} (for a \ex{GET} request),
 \ex{CONTENT\_LENGTH} (for a \ex{POST} request)).  So a query string
 like \codex{button=on\&\ob{}reply=Oh,\ob{}\%20yes} becomes an alist
 \codex{(("button" . "on") ("reply" . "Oh, yes"))}
 
 \ex{Cgi-form-query} only works for \ex{GET} and \ex{POST} methods.
