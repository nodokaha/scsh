This is the Scheme Untergrund Networking Package.

The Scheme Untergrund Networking Package (SUnet, for short) is a
collection of applications and libraries for Internet hacking in
Scheme.  It contains over 15000 lines of high-quality Scheme code that
runs under Scsh, the Scheme shell.  SUnet makes extensive use of
Scsh's facilities for multi-threaded systems programming on Unix.

SUnet includes the following components:

* The SUnet Web server
    This is a highly configurable HTTP 1.0 server in Scheme.
    The server is accompanied some libraries which may also
    be used separately:

    * URI and URL parsers and unparsers
    * a library for writing CGI scripts in Scheme
    * server extensions for interfacing to CGI scripts
    * server extensions for uploading Scheme code
    * simple structured HTML output library

    The server also ships with a sophisticated interface for writing
    server-side Web applications called "SUrflets".

* The SUnet ftp server
    This is a complete anonymous ftp server in Scheme.

* ftp client library
    This library allows you to access ftp servers programmatically.

* Netrc library
    This library parses authentication information contained in ~/.netrc.

* SMTP client library
    This library allows you to forge mail from the comfort of your own
    Scheme process.

* POP3 client library
    This library allows you to access your POP3 mailbox from inside Scsh.

* RFC822 header library
    This library parses email-style headers.

* Daytime and Time protocol client libraries
    These libraries lets you find out what time it is without paying for a
    Rolex.

* DNS client library
    This is a complete, multithreaded DNS library.

* An ls clone
    This library displays Unix-style directory listings without running ls.

Download
========

The SUnet code is available from

http://www.scsh.net/sunet/

To run the code, you need version 0.6.4 or later of Scsh, available from

http://www.scsh.net/

Installation
============

Starting with version 2.1 SUnet conforms to the packaging proposal for
scsh by Michel Schinz and needs Michel's installation library to
install properly. For more information, please see:

<http://lamp.epfl.ch/~schinz/scsh_packages/>

In short, this means that you can install SUnet by unpacking the SUnet
tarball and issuing the following command in the created directory:

scsh-install-pkg --prefix /path/to/your/package/root

See the file INSTALL for the generic installation instructions for
scsh packages.  

You need to install version 4.9 of the SSAX package to use SUnet. SSAX
is available from <http://lamp.epfl.ch/~schinz/scsh_packages/>.

Sample Web Server
=================

The installation procedure also installs three scripts to run the
SUnet httpd in the directory

/path/to/your/package/root/0.6/sunet/web-server/

The three scripts are:

start-web-server for running a simple web server on port 8080
start-extended-web-server for running a web server with rman and info gateway
start-surflet-server for running a web server with SUrflets enabled

Pass the --help option to learn how to configure the scripts.

These scripts should provide a pretty good starting point to set up
your own server or serve your own SUrfelts.
