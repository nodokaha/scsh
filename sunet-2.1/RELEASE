Scheme Untergrund Networking Library Release Notes
==================================================

We are pleased to release SUnet version 2.1.

SUnet runs under scsh 0.6.4.  It is possible, but unlikely that it
runs under earlier versions of scsh. We recommend using version 0.6.6
for simple installation using the new packaging proposal. See file
INSTALL for more details.

The major addition of this release are SUrflets by Andreas
Bernauer. SUrflets are server-side scripts for the web-server written
in Scheme. Based on the idea of Christian Queinnec, SUrflets employ
first-class continuations to overcome the lack of state in the HTTP
protocol and thereby ease the writing of web applications
dramatically. SUrflets represent XHTML using Oleg Kiselyov's SSAX
package, which makes it possible to build on the full power of
s-expressions for generating XHTML.

This release also fixes a number of bugs in various parts of the
library.

Relay, hack, and enjoy!
