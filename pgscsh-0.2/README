PostgreSQL access from the Scheme Shell              -*-indented-text-*-
=======================================

   This module lets you access the PostgreSQL object-relational DBMS
   from within the Scheme Shell. It implements the client part of the
   socket-level frontend/backend protocol, rather than providing a
   wrapper around the libpq library. The module is capable of type
   coercions from a range of SQL types to the equivalent Scheme type,
   and now supports large objects (BLOBs).


Installing ==========================================================

   This library runs under Olin Shivers' Scheme Shell, which adds many
   useful things like sockets, a POSIX interface, records, a module
   system and error handling to Scheme. The scsh can be obtained by
   anonymous ftp from

       <URL:ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/su/scsh/scsh.tar.gz>

   The distribution includes a test file which is executable from the
   command line, and which shows how to use the library via the
   Scheme48 module system.

   NB: The postgres backend must be started with the "-i" argument in
   order to allow TCP/IP connections; they are disallowed with the
   default setup.
