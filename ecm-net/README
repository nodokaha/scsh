Networking code for the Scheme Shell              -*-indented-text-*-
====================================

   This package contains networking code for the Scheme Shell. It
   includes

   * ftp.scm -- a module for transfering files using the FTP protocol

   * pop3.scm -- a module for accessing a maildrop using the POP3
     protocol

   * netrc.scm -- a module for parsing users' ~/.netrc files to
     obtain authentication information

   * nettime.scm -- a module for obtaining the time from remote
     machines, using either the Time (rfc868) or the NetTime (rfc867)
     protocols.

   * test.scm -- an executable scsh script which runs a few tests on
     the library.

  
Installing ==========================================================

   This library runs under Olin Shivers' Scheme Shell, which adds many
   useful things like sockets, a POSIX interface, records, a module
   system and error handling to Scheme. The scsh can be obtained by
   anonymous ftp from

       ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/su/scsh/scsh.tar.gz

   The distribution includes a test file which is executable from the
   command line, and which shows how to use the library via the
   Scheme48 module system.

   Tested with scsh 0.5.1 on Debian Linux 1.3.1 (kernel 2.0.30) and on
   Solaris 2.5.1 with a range of ftp server types and the free
   Qualcomm qpopper daemon. I would particularly appreciate
   information about other servers and their status codes. Please send
   bug reports, suggestions and questions to <emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr>.
