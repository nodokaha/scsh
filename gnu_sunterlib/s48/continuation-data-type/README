The structure CONTINUATION-DATA-TYPE encapsulates continuations into a
data type as proposed by Marc Feeley on the Scheme Workshop 2001.

================================================================================

After installation, use the switch

-lel continuation-data-type/load.scm

to load this library.

================================================================================


(continuation-capture receiver) -> continuation

Captures the current continuation of the expression and applies
RECEIVER to it. Unlike CALL-WITH-CURRENT-CONTINUATION applying the
continuation will immediately replace the current continuation.


(continuation-graft cont thunk) -> value of thunk

Makes the continuation CONT the current continuation and calls THUNK
afterwards.


(continuation-return cont . returned-values) -> returned-values

Makes the continuation CONT the current continuation and returns
RETURNED-VALUES afterwards.
