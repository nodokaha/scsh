Scheme Untergrund Library

REQUIREMENTS

The Scheme Untergrund Library requires that scsh is installed on your
system. If you don't have it, please obtain and install it before
building sunterlib. See the webpage <http://scsh.net/>.

BUILD

If you obtained the source from cvs, type 'make' to build the
package. This is not necessary if you have a tar distribution.

INSTALLATION

As of version 0.6, sunterlib follows Michel Schinz's scsh package
proposal for installation and use. Please see:
  http://lamp.epfl.ch/~schinz/scsh_packages/

Running the installation script (scsh-install-pkg) in the top-level
distribution directory will install all of the libraries.

ISSUE: Currently it is not possible to run the installation script in
an individual library's subdirectory to install just that library.

UNINSTALLATION

See the packaging proposal for details.
