These are generic installation instructions for scsh packages.

Prerequisites
=============

The scsh installation library is required to install this package.
This library *must* be present on your system before the current
package can be installed. It can be obtained from the following Web
page:

  http://lamp.epfl.ch/~schinz/scsh_packages/

The installation library comes with its own documentation which
explains in detail how to install and use scsh packages. It is
recommended that you read it before installing your first scsh
package. What follows is a very brief summary of this documentation,
intended to get you started quickly.


Installation
============

Installation of a scsh package is performed by launching the
"scsh-install-pkg" script, which is part of the scsh installation
library. This script must be launched from within the directory which
resulted from the expansion of the current package's archive, i.e. the
one containing the file you are reading now.

A list of all the arguments accepted by the "scsh-install-pkg" script
can be obtained by launching it with the "--help" option. One of these
arguments, "--prefix", is mandatory and specifies the location where
installation should be performed. Ideally, you should use the same
prefix to install all scsh packages, as this makes them easier to
manage and use.

For example, to install the current package in
"/usr/local/share/scsh-modules", you should type the following:

  scsh-install-pkg --prefix=/usr/local/share/scsh-modules

Provided that no errors are encountered during installation, a
message will be printed at the end explaining how to use the newly
installed package.
